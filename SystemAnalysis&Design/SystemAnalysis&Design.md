## System Analysis Design

### An Overview of System Analysis and Design

#### Overview

* requirments analysis

* use case modeling(用例建模)

* design principles: useful experience; S. O. L. I. D

* architecture design: higher level than program design

* obiject-ortiented design

* domain driven design(领域驱动设计)

#### Assessment

* Attendance: 10%

* Team Project (no more than 5 members): 90%

  + Project vision, scope and essential requirements will be released in Week 3.
  + Software Requirements Specification(说明书): 30%
  + Analysis Model(platform independent design; ideal design) and *Middle-Term presentation*: 30%
  + Design Model(proof of concept), *final presentation* and qualities of final deliveries: 30%

#### Preperations

* Reference Books: 

* Modeling Tools: Unified Modeling Language: UML: StarUML

* Collaboration Environment: Github; Gitlab

17. Final Presentation 2

* c++
  + describe the experience: 
  + the most challenging thing is facing the unknown risks, but is also the exciting thing
  + turn software programing into real solution
  + not only solve, but also avoid
  + collaborate with the upstream and the downstream

* need for system analysis and design
  + make everyone and share

* architectural design prescribe by the construction and visualized to the apperence

### Project Management and Information Requirements Analysis

#### project management fundamentals

* project initiation
  + basic vision and scope
  + problem in organization
  + defining the problems
  + set up goals
  + selection of project

* determining project feasibility(可行性)
  + estimating workloads
  + hardware and software needs
  + managing time and activities

* activity planning and control
  + think about PPPT: product, people, procise, technology

* project scheduling
  + gantt chart(甘特图) to schedule the project
  + PERT diagrams 
    - evaluate the real deadline
    - time estimation: optimistic(O), most likely(M), pessimistic(P, 悲观) PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6

* ascerting hardware and software needs
  + think beyond only our project: use cloud computing platform, service vendor(供应商)
  + Elastic Container Service(ECS)
  + supproting enviornment
  + influence a lot on how to biuld the project

* conttrolling a project
  + estimating cost and preparing the budget
  + managing risks: fishbone diagram

* team management
  + API
  + OKR: object and key results

* prototyping(原型设计)
  + information-*gathering* technique
  + Figma, Lanhu
  + use program prototype not interface prototype

* the agile approach : classtic mistakes
  + a project is subdivided into iterations
  + measure and evaluate the schedule
  + quality
  + manipulating scope(操作范围)
  + [values and principles of agile modeling](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/zhchs/manifesto.html)
  + principle
    - coding
    - testing
    - listening
    - designing

* Gitlab
  + project management
  + scrum and kanban-style

- scrum: one of the agile method

### OOAD, UP and UML
