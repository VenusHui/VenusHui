## Course Introduction and the Relational Model

## Database Storage 1

Volatile & Non-Volatile Devices

Disk-Oriented DBMS

- organized into pages

- page directory

- buffer pool

### File Storage

Linked List

Page Directory

### Page Layout

header : page size, checksum, DBMS version, transaction visibility, etc.

Tuple-Oriented (most common)

- header : keeps the track of the number of used slots and the offset of the starting location of last used slot and a slot array, which keeps track of the location of the start of each tuple.

- slotted pages & slot array

- pack the entire tuple in a single page (only: two related table ,"pre-join", can make two table on the same page)

Log-Structrue

### Tuple Layout

header : Visibility information for the DBMSâ€™s concurrency control protocol, bitmap for `NULL` values, etc.

most DBMS do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of page

most common : `page_id + (offset or slot)`
